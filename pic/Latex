\section{Introduction}
Using 4 Segmentation Methods, include 3 most recently methods and a new approach:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sliding Window}
  \item \textbf{Bottom-up}
  \item \textbf{Top-down}
  \item \textbf{SWAB(Sliding Window And Bottom-up)}
\end{itemize}  
  to extract  a segment of anomaly subsequences from 10 different  datasets.

Then, let's determine which method should be used for each time series, and explore how to determine  the maximum error for each method, as well as its correlation with time series features.
\section{Dataset}
\subsection{Non-cyclic}
At first, an easy-detected timeseries, with 8640 data points
\begin{itemize}
  \item mean value: 100, noise level: 100, standard deviation around the mean:$1\%$
\end{itemize}
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{1.png}

\begin{itemize}
  \item increase standard deviation: 20\% ,decrease noise level: 50
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{2.png}

\begin{itemize}
  \item add an upward-trend component and a complicated anomaly subsequence
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Non-linear trend 
\end{itemize}

Last,we generated a x5 larger dataset to evaluate the time.

\subsection{Cyclic}
Five cyclic dataset, from simple to complex:

\subsection{SWaT 2019}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{data_2019.png}
Include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-cyclic: P601 Status, MV501
    \item Cyclic: LIT 301, MV201, P101 Status, P301 Status
\end{itemize}

\section{Segmentation}  
\subsection{Extract Anomaly Segment}
Each Algorithms returned many segments. What we will do next, is to choose which one is the Anomaly.


Ex: Apply Bottom-up on LIT 301
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{ex.png}
  \caption{Apply Bottom-up on LIT 30}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Get the distance: Let assign a segment $s_i$ by 2 point ($x_{i_1}$,$y_{i_1}$) and ($x_{i_2}$,$y_{i_2}$). We calculate the distance ($d$) to the previous and the next segment by:
\begin{center}
    $d_{S_i}$ = $({y_{{i-1}_2}}-y_{i_1}) + (y_{i_2}-y_{{i+1}_1})$

\end{center}
That means we count the one-side diferrence with the previous point and the next point.
    \item Then select the segment with the greatest distance among them to evaluate metrics.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Experimental Results 
}

By choose the best max-error for each data and algorithms, then get the most-describe anomaly segment, we use classification metrics to evaluate the performance. The segment with the F1-Score greater than 0.7, we assume that this anomaly sequence is detectable. First, with some simple data:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{non_cyclic.png}
  \caption{Perfomance with non-cyclic data}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{low_RSD.png}
  \caption{Perfomance with low RSD($<0.1$) data}
\end{figure}

The Topdown and the Sliding Window show better perfomance with 14/15 cases, the worst is Bottom-up to the simple data


\newpage
Next, with the more complicated data:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{cyclic.png}
  \caption{Perfomance with cyclic data}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{high_RSD.png}
  \caption{Perfomance with high RSD($>0.1$) data}
\end{figure}

The SWAB demonstrates the best results, while the Bottom-up remains the worst.

Conclusion, with the non-cyclic data, the Top-down is the best choice, on the other hand, SWAB looks better to all of them with the cyclic one. Slilding Window is also good for both cyclic and non-cyclic data, but still worse than Top-down and SWAB in each situation

\newpage
Finally, we saying about the time:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Time.png}
  \caption{Time average on whole 16 dataset, and lagrest data (Id = 5)}
\end{figure}

The Top-down algorithm is slower than the Sliding-window approach by up to 15-20 times. In comparision to the Bottom-up and the SWAB one, it's also slower about 6 times.


\section{Max Errror}
The Experimental Results is depend mostly on choosing max error.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Correlation_matrix.png}
  \caption{Correlation between Max-error and Some features of TimeSeries}
\end{figure}

Where: $min(max\_error)$ and $max(max\_error)$ is range of $max\_error$ that we can see actually the anomaly being segmented.  This range typically corresponds to when the F1-Score is greater than 0.7. In situations where the algorithms can't detect the anomaly (selecting false segment), we still choose the most visuallize the anomaly segment.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Sliding-Window and especially  the Top-down has most relation to $standard\_deviation$ and $variance$
    \item On the other hand, the Bottom-up and SWAB has strong correlation to $absolute\_sum\_of\_change$ and $mean\_abs\_change$
\end{itemize}
